# MultiCube
A small C# console application to display multiple cubes in windows, based on <a href="https://github.com/filthycoding/RotatingCube">previous project of mine</a>.

Controls:

  - W and S rotate the cube up or down in the x-axis.
  - A and D rotate the cube up or down in the y-axis.
  - J and K rotate the cube up or down in the z-axis.
  - Hold ALT before holding any above keys and the cube will rotate faster.
  - Same goes for SHIFT, except it's going to rotate slower.
  - Press M to toggle between manual (default) and automatic modes. Also note that you can't control the cube in this mode.
  - Press number buttons 1 to 9 (Numpad or numeric row) to change the selected window.
  - Press ESC to exit the program at any time.
